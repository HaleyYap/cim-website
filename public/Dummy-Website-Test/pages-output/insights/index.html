<meta name="description" content="HeadlinesFounded in 2017, Yatsen Holding Limited (NYSE: YSG) is a leading China-based beauty group. It operates various skincare and color cosmetics brands, including Galénic, DR.WU, Eve Lom, and Perfect Diary. Yatsen focuses on providing high-quality beauty products to consumers in China and internationally.As of March 7th, 6:52 pm GMT, the stock price of YSG is $0.51 USD, reflecting a month-on-month decline of 18.9% and a year-on-year decline of 31.8%.Yatsen has experienced both growth and challenges in its financial performance. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported a 6.7% increase in total net revenues compared to the prior year period.However, the company’s total net revenues for the full year of 2023 decreased by 7.9% compared to the previous year, indicating a potential slowdown in growth. Yatsen also reported a net loss of RMB 750.2 million (US$105.7 million) for the full year of 2023, which decreased by 8.7% compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to significantly increased marketing expenses while sales volume remained weak. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company recorded a goodwill impairment, indicating that the carrying value of the Eve Lom reporting unit exceeded its fair value. This impairment was primarily attributed to weaker operating results than expected at the time of acquisition. Such impairments can negatively impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in the stock price.In terms of past deals, Yatsen has focused on brand acquisition and geographical expansion. In 2020, the company acquired the beauty brand Little Ondine and the French skincare player Galenic. In 2021, it acquired the British premium skincare brand Eve Lom. In 2023, Yatsen’s jointly built factory with Cosmax Inc., a major cosmetics manufacturer in South Korea, began operations in Guangzhou, China.Looking ahead, Yatsen aims to pursue sustainable growth through ongoing innovation across its brands. The company’s strategic plan includes brand repositioning, new product launches, and a focus on enhancing research and development capabilities. With the newly built factory, Yatsen is transitioning from an OEM to an ODM business model, which is expected to improve quality control and potentially lead to an increase in sales volume in future reporting periods.Source:">
