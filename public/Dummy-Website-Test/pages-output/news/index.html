<meta name="description" content="HeadlinesWritten by Erika LauThe U.S. stock market mostly ended higher for the week, driven by favorable inflation news. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 reached record levels, with the S&amp;P 500 having its strongest start to the year since 2019. The gains were broad-based, with an equal-weighted version of the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the market capitalization version. Large, technology-oriented growth stocks continued to outperform, contributing to the overall performance.The release of the Commerce Department’s core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is considered the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, helped boost market sentiment. The index rose 2.8% for the 12 months ended in January, in line with expectations, alleviating concerns raised by the Labor Department’s consumer price index, which showed higher-than-expected core prices.

Durable goods showed a more positive outlook, and personal incomes saw a significant increase in February.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note reached its lowest level in weeks, reflecting the positive reaction to the PCE data and the downside surprise in the manufacturing sector.

</p></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="Week of 22/03/2024"><p><em>Written by Kevin Xia</em></p><h3 id="us">US:</h3><p>Oil Prices Rise on Strong Global Demand and Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Oil prices rose on March 13, 2024, on expectations of strong global demand, including in the United States, and as even somewhat sticky U.S. inflation did not dent expectations the Fed might start cutting rates soon. Brent futures for May delivery were up 36 cents, or 0.44%, at $82.28 a barrel.</p><p>US Consumer Prices Rise: The consumer price index increased 0.4% for the month of February and 3.2% from a year ago. The monthly gain was in line with expectations, but the annual rate was slightly ahead of the 3.1% forecast from the Dow Jones consensus.</p><p>US Fed: The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday for the fifth consecutive meeting, as the central bank awaits more data to determine when to cut rates.</p><h3 id="europe">Europe:</h3><p>European and US Equity Futures Trade Higher: On March 18, 2024, European and US equity futures traded higher following a selloff in equities and bonds when markets rounded off a week that saw hot inflation concerns roiled markets.</p><p>Europe's Worst Earnings Season Since Covid: Europe had its worst earnings season since the onset of Covid.</p><p>Red Sea Situation and Fruit Exports: Maersk's March 2024 market update covered the Red Sea situation, fruit exports, port updates, inland solutions, labor regulations, and last-mile strategies.</p><p>Eurozone Inflation Drops to 2.4%: The European Central Bank (ECB) was slower to raise interest rates, but that did not stop eurozone inflation from dropping to 2.4%, just above the 2% target rate.</p><h3 id="asia">Asia:</h3><p>Asia Markets Fall Ahead of Central Bank Interest Rate Decisions: On March 18, 2024, Asia-Pacific markets fell ahead of central bank monetary policy decisions from the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Asian Markets Mixed Ahead of Bank of Japan Decision: On March 19, 2024, Asian markets were mixed ahead of a much-anticipated Bank of Japan meeting.
</p></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="Week of 4/04/2024"><p><em>Written by Jonathan Chen</em></p><h3 id="us-1">US:</h3><p>While the S&amp;P 500 ended a record-setting streak by falling just below the flatline, it still managed to secure a win for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight increase of about 0.2%, whereas the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite experienced a minor drop close to 0.4%. This mixed closing was amid investors bracing for the Fed's upcoming meeting, focusing on potential rate cuts and the central bank's latest viewpoint on inflation and economic growth.</p><p>The week also highlighted anticipation for major tech companies' earnings reports, with Alphabet and Microsoft set to start the earnings season. These reports are keenly watched due to the significant influence these companies have on both the global economy and investors' portfolios.</p><p>Furthermore, the US market witnessed crude oil gaining more than 6% over the week, driven by bullish economic data and ongoing tensions in the Red Sea region. This rise in oil prices was supported by freezing temperatures affecting US production, a reduction in crude inventories, and various global economic factors.</p><h3 id="europe-1">Europe:</h3><p>The Swiss National Bank made a surprise interest rate cut, becoming the first major financial center to do so recently. Investors were also anticipating major economies' manufacturing PMI and CPI data as they continue to address inflation concerns.</p><p>Additionally, European stocks experienced mixed movements, with the tech sector influencing Wall Street's performance and Bitcoin's value jumping significantly. The Dutch TTF benchmark for European gas prices saw a significant decrease, suggesting a possible easing of the energy
crisis.</p><h3 id="asia-1">Asia:</h3><p>Chinese regulators reportedly blocked Syngenta's planned $9bn Shanghai IPO due to liquidity concerns. Indian stocks did not experience the traditional pre-election rally as the country prepares for parliamentary elections; US yields and a significant earthquake impacted markets like Nikkei and Hang Seng. Meanwhile, China's solar sector is facing oversupply and low prices, suggesting a year of consolidation ahead.</p><p>Sources:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.euronews.com/tag/european-markets">https://www.euronews.com/tag/european-markets</a></li><li><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-ends-record-setting-streak-but-stocks-notch-weekly-win-134707886.html?guccounter=1">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-ends-record-setting-streak-but-stocks-notch-weekly-win-134707886.html?guccounter=1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/markets">https://www.asiafinancial.com/markets</a></li></ol></x-accordion><x-accordion summary="Week of 19/04/2024"><p><em>Written by Leo Xu Mingyuan</em></p><h3 id="us-2">US:</h3><p>Stocks recorded their third consecutive week of broad losses, as concerns over tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of U.S. interest rates remaining high. Mega-cap technology shares lagged as rising rates placed a higher theoretical discount on future earnings.</p><p>Some strong economic data appeared to increase worries that the Federal Reserve would push back any interest rates cuts to the fall, if not to 2025. On Monday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.7% in March, well above consensus expectations of around 0.3%, while February’s gain was revised upward to 0.9%. The retail sales data helped push the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to its highest intraday level since last November.</p><p>Fed officials expressed their concern with recent economic data. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at an economic conference that "recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence."</p><h3 id="europe-2">Europe:</h3><p>Consumer prices in the UK grew an annual 3.2% in March, down from 3.4% in February. Although the inflation rate fell to its lowest level in two and a half years, the decline was slightly less than forecast by Bank of England (BoE) due to elevated price growth in fuel and communication goods. Higher oil prices and the somewhat sticky inflation data prompted financial markets to push out expectations for a first cut in UK interest rates from June to sometime in the fall.</p><p>European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers at the IMF meeting reiterated that June was the likely target date for lowering borrowing costs, barring unexpected economic shocks. Three to four rate cuts this year priced in by markets were in line with the bank’s economic outlook.</p><h3 id="asia-2">Asia:</h3><p>Chinese equities rose after the economy expanded more than expected in the first quarter. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.52%, while the blue chip CSI 300 added 1.89%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index gave up 2.89% as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East hurt investor sentiment.</p><p>China’s gross domestic product expanded an above-consensus 5.3% in the first quarter from a year ago, accelerating slightly from the 5.2% growth in last year’s fourth quarter. On the monetary policy front, the People’s Bank of China injected RMB 100 billion into the banking system via its medium-term lending facility compared with RMB 170 billion in maturing loans and left the lending rate unchanged, as expected. The operation resulted in a net withdrawal of RMB 70 billion from the banking system, marking the second cash extraction this year.</p><p>Sources:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.troweprice.com/personal-investing/resources/insights/global-markets-weekly-update.html">https://www.troweprice.com/personal-investing/resources/insights/global-markets-weekly-update.html</a></li></ol></x-accordion>
