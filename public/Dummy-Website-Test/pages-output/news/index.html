<meta name="description" content="HeadlinesThe U.S. stock market mostly ended higher for the week, driven by favorable inflation news. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 reached record levels, with the S&amp;P 500 having its strongest start to the year since 2019. The gains were broad-based, with an equal-weighted version of the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the market capitalization version. Large, technology-oriented growth stocks continued to outperform, contributing to the overall performance.The release of the Commerce Department’s core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is considered the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, helped boost market sentiment. The index rose 2.8% for the 12 months ended in January, in line with expectations, alleviating concerns raised by the Labor Department’s consumer price index, which showed higher-than-expected core prices. Despite the positive reaction in the stock market, Federal Reserve policymakers maintained their stance of not rushing to cut interest rates.The manufacturing sector, however, surrendered some of its recent momentum, with the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) gauge of manufacturing activity falling below expectations in February. Durable goods showed a more positive outlook, and personal incomes saw a significant increase in February.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note reached its lowest level in weeks, reflecting the positive reaction to the PCE data and the downside surprise in the manufacturing sector. U.S. Treasuries generated positive returns as yields decreased, and municipal bonds received an additional boost from light issuance.In the investment-grade corporate bond market, spreads widened due to heavy supply, as February saw a record-breaking amount of new issuance. High yield market trading activity was subdued early in the week but tightened credit spreads following the release of the core PCE price data.Overall, the U.S. stock market experienced gains, driven by positive inflation news, while the manufacturing sector showed a slight decline. Bond markets reacted positively to the economic data, and corporate bond issuance reached a new record in February.">
