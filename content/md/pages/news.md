#### U.S.

Benchmarks mixed as small-caps and value shares outperform

Some favorable earnings surprises balanced against discouraging inflation data left the major benchmarks mixed, with the S&P 500 Index recording its first weekly decline since the start of the year. The declines were concentrated in large-cap growth stocks, however, with an equally weighted version of the S&P 500 reaching a record intraday high on Thursday. After suffering its biggest daily drop since June on Tuesday, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index rebounded to lead the gains for the week. T. Rowe Price traders noted that trading volumes also picked up later in the week, after a very quiet start on Monday following the football weekend and with multiple markets shut for holidays, including the Chinese New Year and Carnival celebrations on the eve of the start of Lent on Wednesday.
